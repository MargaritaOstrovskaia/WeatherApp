# WeatherApp
My final project on "Build Your First Android App (Project-Centered Course)" by CentraleSup√©lec.

## About project "WeatherApp".
I took information from weather API (https://www.metaweather.com/api/) using JSON GET request.

**1 screen (Cities)** - list cities with current temperature and weather state (choose one and go on 3 screen), button + add new city to list, so we have button for go to settings screen (2 screen).

**2 screen (Weather)** - you can choose:
* day (city name, weather state, current temperature, maximum and minimum temperature, list additional information: wind, pressure, humidity, visibility) 
* week (city name, list: date  / weather state image / maximum and minimum temperature) information about temperature
We have arrow button come back to 1 screen and button to remove city.

**3 screen (Settings)** - choose your temperature (celsius or fahrenheit) and wind speed (kph or mph), arrow button come back to 1 screen.

**4 screen (Search day)** - enter city for search this city from list and click to add on 1 screen.
